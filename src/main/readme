================================= MVC PRACTICE
In this bonus, you will build out the (C)reate and (R)ead CRUD functionality for cars.
1. commit all your current work
2. branch off of the 'mvc-exercise' branch into a new branch called 'mvc-cars'
3. create the MVC logic for creating and viewing all cars using the Ads as an example
The Car entity should have the following:
  id (use a long type)
  make (use a string type)
  model (use a string type)
  year (use an int)
The following are some of the files you will need to add:
  ShowCarsServlet
  CreateCarServlet
  Car model class
  Cars interface
  ListCarsDao
  You will also need to add a getCarsDao method to the DaoFactory
  In a new cars directory in WEB-INF of webapp...
    index.jsp
    create.jsp
